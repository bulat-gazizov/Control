# QubitControl â€“ qBittorent remote control .

QubitControl is a simple application that connects to remotely running qBittorent and displays it Web UI in the embedded WebBrowser.
Main advantage of the QubitControl is the ability to accept command line argument (torrent file name or magnet link). 

This allows user to set up QubitControl as default application for your web browser to open torrent file URLs and magnet links. Unlike similar plugins, QubitControl is browser independant.
